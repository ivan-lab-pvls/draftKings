          'Marcus Slaughter prosecuted for falsifying a passport when playing for Real Madrid',
      article:
          '''Slaughter's Equatorial Guinea passport he received in 2015 was 'false in nature,' and the player is being prosecuted for it. If he is pronounced guilty, Barca will ask basketball authorities to strip Real Madrid of their titles in 2015 when Slaughter was on the roster. 
A case has been opened in the 27th Court of Madrid, and a trial will commence, La Vanguardia writes.
The local authorities had been looking for Slaughter and former Fuenlabrada player Andy Panko, who's also involved in the case, for multiple years. It was unsuccessful to the degree that the court had to issue a search warrant in the summer of 2023 (requested by FC Barcelona) to serve the required court documents to the defendants. Only now have the court documents been legally presented to all entities.
Slaughter received an Equatorial Guinea passport in 2015, just days before the start of Copa del Rey. The procedure was done so that the big man could compete as a local in the mini-tournament due to the Cotonou Agreement.
It was later found out that the information provided on the passport was false. Namely, both Slaughter and Panko's passports shared the same passport number - A001696. Additionally, pages 45 and 46 were missing. The documents were "false in nature, since although they were originally legitimate documents, their entire biographical pages had been replaced," the prosecutor said. 
The Embassy of Equatorial Guinea has admitted that the documents are false, but the case was prolonged due to multiple delays.
To acquire the passports, Slaughter and Panko have previously admitted having paid 35,000 euros in cash each to Richard Nguema, a former Real Madrid youth player who had contacts in the government of Equatorial Guinea,La Vanguardia adds. The Prosecutor's Office requests sixteen months in prison for those accused of document falsification.
Real Madrid won both Liga Endesa and Copa del Rey in 2015. As such, FC Barcelona, who have been actively involved in the case for the entirety of the nine-year period, will ask the basketball authorities to strip Real Madrid of the titles if Slaughter is pronounced guilty.
Real Madrid are not named as defendants in the case, as neither of the plaintiffs claim the organization had knowledge of the wrongdoing.
"We will ask that Madrid be stripped of its titles," Barca's lawyer Jordi Pina said on RAC1 radio.''',

The move gives the young Thunder another much-needed veteran presence and additional frontcourt depth as they prepare for a playoff push this season. OKC currently has a 35-17 record, good for fourth-best in the Western Conference.
Biyombo, 31, played 30 games for the Memphis Grizzlies this season before getting waived. He averaged 5.2 points and 6.4 rebounds, and he is expected to shore up a Thunder frontline that only features Rookie-of-the-Year candidate Chet Holmgren and second-year big man Jaylin Williams.''',

      article: '''The New York Knicks have acquired forward Bojan Bogdanovic and guard Alec Burks from the Detroit Pistons for guards Quentin Grimes, Evan Fournier, Malachi Flynn, Ryan Arcidiacono and two second round picks, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.
Acquiring veteran pieces in Bogdanovic and Burks strengthens the Knicks’ core as they hope to embark on a deep playoff run this season. New York is currently tied with the Milwaukee Bucks in third place in the Eastern Conference with a 33-18 record.
New York is the first contender in the East to make a splashy move as they feel like this core, led by All-Stars Jalen Brunson and Julius Randle, could contend the East.
Bogdanovic, 34, is averaging 20.2 points while shooting 41.5% from three-point range this season. Bogdanovic will likely start at power forward as Randle recovers from a shoulder injury and he'll provide scoring alongside Brunson, giving the Knicks additional firepower.
Burks, 32, returns to New York after spending two seasons with the team from 2020 to 2022. He’s currently averaging 12.6 points and 2.6 rebounds while shooting 40% from three in 43 games this season. Burks gives the Knicks a secondary ball handler and bucket-getter off the bench.
Detroit receives two future second-rounders and four guards (Grimes, Fournier, Flynn and Arcidiacono). Grimes, the 25th overall pick in 2021, was moved to the bench this season in favor of Donte DiVincenzo. Fournier and Arcidiacono didn't get many minutes in Tom Thibodeau’s rotation, while Flynn just recently arrived from Toronto as part of the OG Anunoby trade and never established himself in the lineup.''',

          'Sixers acquire Buddy Hield from Pacers for 3 second-round picks',
      article: '''The Philadelphia 76ers are acquiring Buddy Hield from the Indiana Pacers in exchange for Furkan Korkmaz, Marcus Morris and three second-round picks, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.
The Sixers, desperately in need of shooting, got their guy hours before the trade deadline. Hield is averaging 12 points per game on 38.4% shooting from three-point range. Philadelphia is currently ranked 29th in the NBA in three-point attempts this season, ahead of only the Detroit Pistons. Hield is a high-volume three-point shooter who will immediately play a key role on the depleted Sixers.
The Sixers sent away Korkmaz, who has been on the team for his entire career but has requested multiple trades throughout his stint in Philly. Averaging just over eight minutes per game, he hasn't had much of a role on the Sixers.
Philly also shipped off Morris, who was recently acquired by Philadelphia in the James Harden trade. He had some significant moments in his short stint with Philadelphia. Morris told Basketball News how incredible it was to play in Philly, and it’s clear he’ll never forget that experience.
I asked Marcus Morris what being back in Philly meant to him, especially on a night like tonight. “I’ve been an eagles fan my whole life. Been a Sixers fan my whole life. Being able to put that jersey on, it’s not for forever, I’m happy to be able to say i did it.”
All things considered, the Sixers didn’t send out much to get Hield and they still have a lot of assets to use elsewhere. Multiple reports have indicated that the Sixers will be aggressive at the deadline, so they may not be done wheeling and dealing.
For the Pacers, they get three second-round picks back for Hield, who was in the final year of his contract and expected to walk in free agency if they didn't trade him.''',

Dinwiddie and his agent, Jason Glushon, attended last night's Lakers game and sat with general manager Rob Pelinka, sparking rumors that the 6-foot-5 guard was close to joining Los Angeles.

His free-agency decision came down to the Lakers and Dallas Mavericks.
Signing Dinwiddie makes sense for the Lakers, who are looking for additional guard play with reserve point guard Gabe Vincent still out. Dinwiddie’s playmaking and secondary scoring will help Los Angeles as they look to make a playoff push.''',

This moment marks a historic achievement for O’Neal as he becomes the fourth NBA player to have his jersey retired by three different franchises, joining an elite list that features all-time greats Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Pete Maravich. “The Big Diesel” also has his jersey retired by the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat after he led them to championships.''',

          'Warriors, 76ers tried to acquire Lakers\' LeBron James before deadline',
      article: '''The Golden State Warriors and Philadelphia 76ers inquired about Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James prior to the NBA’s trade deadline on February 8, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski and Ramona Shelburne.
Warriors owner Joe Lacob (with the encouragement of star forward Draymond Green) reached out to Lakers owner Jeanie Buss to inquire about the availability of James in hopes of pairing him with longtime rival Stephen Curry. However, Buss (and James) quickly turned down Golden State.
After struggling to make waves all season, the Warriors attempted to add James at the deadline and extend their dynastic run. Even at 39 years old, James is still playing at a high level with a skill set that would complement Curry, Green and Klay Thompson.
ESPN reported: “Buss told Lacob the Lakers had no desire to trade James, but that he would need to seek the answer on James' state of mind from his agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, sources said. As an owner, Buss has operated with the mindset that she wants her star players content with the franchise, and that instructed her thinking on referring Warriors leadership to James' representation, sources said.
"If the Lakers ever wanted a temperature check on James' commitment, here was his chance. In the end, the answer was returned resoundingly on the eve of the trade deadline: Paul told Lacob and Warriors GM Mike Dunleavy Jr., that James had no interest in a trade and wanted to remain a Laker, sources said. When Dunleavy reached out to Lakers GM Rob Pelinka in those pre-trade deadline hours, Dunleavy had been told the same: The Lakers wanted to keep James."
Green, who is also represented by Rich Paul’s Klutch Sports, went the extra mile and asked Paul to help persuade James to come to Golden State, but to no avail.
“Earlier Wednesday, Green -- whom Paul also represents at Klutch -- had sent Paul a text message soliciting his help in convincing James to join him in Golden State, sources said. Once, Green had been a lead recruiter on Kevin Durant's free agency signing with Golden State, but this was a far different, far more futile 11th-hour pursuit," Wojnarowski and Shelburne reported.
Moreover, Sixers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey also joined in the LeBron James sweepstakes but was immediately denied by Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka. Wojnarowski and Shelburne revealed that Pelinka responded to Morey by asking if superstar Joel Embiid was available, but that immediately ended their trade conversation.
“Dunleavy was the second team executive call to Pelinka on a possible James trade, sources said. After seeing James' cryptic social media post of an hourglass a week before the trade deadline, Philadelphia 76ers president of basketball operations Daryl Morey called Pelinka to probe on a James trade and was immediately told that James wasn't available," the report states. "In fact, Pelinka responded by asking Morey if Joel Embiid was available, sources said. And that ended that brief conversation.”
Ultimately, James stayed put in Los Angeles and two sides remain committed to each other for the rest of the season as they look to gain important positioning for the playoffs. The Lakers currently sit in ninth place in the Western Conference with a 29-26 record.''',

          'The Cavs are playing their best basketball of the Donovan Mitchell era',
      article: '''The Cleveland Cavaliers are the hottest team in the Eastern Conference, winning 14 of their last 15 games. The Cavs are currently 32-16, which is their best record through 48 games in five years.
With Monday night’s win over the Sacramento Kings, the Cavaliers have climbed past the Milwaukee Bucks for second place in the Eastern Conference standings and first place in the Central Division. They are now just five games behind the Boston Celtics for first in the East.
This is somewhat uncharted territory for ‘The Land’ as they have not been on any kind of streak like this before. Since 2024 began, they have the league’s best record at 15-2 to surpass the franchise record for the best start to a calendar year. LeBron James’ 2008, 2010 and 2016 Cavaliers teams previously held the record with 12-3 marks.
Two of those James-led teams lost to the Finals-bound Celtics (2008 and 2010) while the 2016 squad won it all, which bodes well for this version of the Cavaliers with championship aspirations.
Their next 10 games to close out February include six teams below .500 and two games against a Philadelphia 76ers team without reigning MVP Joel Embiid, meaning this hot streak could continue. Their upcoming schedule is at Washington, at Brooklyn, at Toronto, vs. Philadelphia, vs. Chicago, vs. Orlando, at Phildelphia, at Washington, vs. Dallas and at Chicago.
The key to Cleveland’s hot streak has been their main cog, Donovan Mitchell. Recently named to his fifth straight All-Star Game, the 6-foot-3 guard is averaging 28.2 points, 6.4 assists, 5.5 rebounds and 1.9 steals per game this season. The superb Mitchell has been willing the Cavs to win. What’s more impressive is that Mitchell started this hot streak without fellow centerpieces Darius Garland and Evan Mobley in the lineup (although they have since returned from injuries).
Now, with Garland and Mobley back in the fold, the Cavaliers are even more lethal offensively and defensively as they look to contend in the Eastern Conference. Mobley’s return has been impactful for Cleveland as they are tied for the best defense in the league in 2024, having a defensive rating of 105.4 along with the new-look New York Knicks.
The Cavaliers also filled a big need in the offseason by adding shooters Max Strus and Georges Niang in free agency. In last year’s playoffs, they were exposed by the Knicks as they lacked outside shooting to complement Mitchell and Garland’s drives and pick-and-roll actions with non-shooting big men Mobley and Jarrett Allen.
This season, the Cavs’ offseason signing of Strus has been huge, with the 6-foot-6 wing providing the necessary spacing. Strus was immediately inserted into the starting lineup over mainstays Caris LeVert and Isaac Okoro and it has done wonders for Cleveland.
Off the bench, Niang also provides the same threat from outside in certain situations. The Cavs also rewarded Sam Merrill with some playing time, and he’s been balling and shooting the ball at a high clip as of late, helping the team go on this amazing run.
Speaking of LeVert and Okoro, both wings have made noticeable improvements from last season with each playing a specified role suited to their strengths. LeVert comes in as a secondary playmaker and shotmaker to ease the burden on Garland and Mitchell, while Okoro plays lockdown defense on the opponent’s best perimeter player as well as providing timely cuts to the rim and knocking down the occasional three-pointer.
Moreover, head coach J.B. Bickerstaff has found his ideal rotation now that they’re fully healthy again. Garland, Mitchell, Strus, Mobley and Allen are the team’s usual starting five, and then off the bench comes Dean Wade, Okoro and LeVert. The Cavs always leave one big on the floor at all times (either Mobley or Allen) when the bench players come in while Garland and Mitchell’s minutes get staggered in the middle of quarters. Niang and Merrill are their ninth and 10th men, providing a deep bench whenever they need extra shooting on the floor or when Strus struggles from outside.
Now, the Cavaliers will try to finish the season strong and hope that their regular-season success will translate to the postseason.''',

          'Bulls fought fire with fire against Wolves, earning best win of season',
      article: '''On Tuesday night, the Chicago Bulls tried something new against the Minnesota Timberwolves: starting their two centers, Nikola Vucevic and Andre Drummond, together.
The Bulls normally start Vucevic and surround him with four perimeter players, but head coach Billy Donovan elected to move Vucevic to the four in this game and play Drummond alongside him at the five.
The Bulls started the two big men to counter Minnesota’s huge frontline of Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert, and the results were rather interesting.
The two-man lineup of Vucevic and Drummong has appeared in just seven games and played 54 minutes together. However, in those seven games, the pairing has the highest offensive rating (130.6) and overall net rating (14.3) Vucevic has had with a teammate this season.
Against the Wolves, Vucevic and Drummond had a net rating of 8.7 and a plus-minus of +3. They shared the floor for 25 minutes, achieving an offensive net rating of 134.7 – again, the highest of all two-man lineups with Vucevic.
Although there were some spacing issues, the two big men worked their way around it on some offensive sets. The rest of the minutes were then staggered to cater to each big man and have a different playstyle for each when they were on the floor.
Out of Vucevic’s 10 baskets, half of those came with Drummond on the floor. Among those were pick-and-pop jumpers (2), fadeaway jumpers from the left wing (2), and a driving floater in the lane.
On Vucevic’s two threes, the Bulls utilized the two big men differently. First, Drummond sets a high pick for the ballhandler while Vucevic trails down the floor at the top of the key. Vucevic’s man, Naz Reid, helps at the nail on the drive, leaving Vucevic open for the triple.
What’s even more impressive is that the two started practicing the twin-towers combo the day of the game.
“We just started practicing it today,” Drummong said post-game. “That wasn't long either, but we figured it out. He's a smart player, I'm a smart player. I stay out of his way and likewise. We figured it out throughout the game and found good chemistry."
The 12-year veteran thrived against the three-time DPOY Gobert and Minnesota's top-ranked defense. Drummond was backing Gobert down in the paint, pulling off some highlight plays and celebrating with “too small” gestures after he scored.

With this interesting lineup, the Bulls scored 129 points, which is way more than what the Wolves usually allows (106.8 points per game), as they have the best defensive net rating in the NBA.
Vucevic and Drummond ended up combining for 40 points, and this allowed Coby White to take over in the fourth quarter and overtime. With the Wolves' defense keying in on both bigs, White came up with 21 points in the fourth quarter on 7-of-8 from the field, including 4-of-5 from three. He finished the game with 33 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds.
An Most-Improved-Player frontrunner, White knocked down tough threes late in the game, which has been a big part of his improvement this year.
But the spotlight belonged to Vucevic and Drummond. Even though it was a small sample size, there's excitement about how the pairing can be used against certain matchups going forward.
“They got to pick their poison,” Drummond said of his pairing with Vucevic. “Whether you let me beat you up in the paint or he [Vucevic] can shoot the three or beat you up in the paint too. So, it's a great tandem, for sure.”''',
