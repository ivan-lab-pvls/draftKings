      title: 'Brock Purdy shares where the 49ers offense has to be better moving forward',
      article: '''During the 49ers’ run to the Super Bowl, they dug themselves a whole offensively after struggling on first down.
That didn’t necessarily change in the Super Bowl, as they still lacked consistency. Take the first two drives, for example. Christian McCaffrey ran for six yards, then caught a pass and had a carry for 11 yards. But, on the fourth first down, he fumbled.
Then, Brock Purdy found Brandon Aiyuk for a gain of 18 yards, but Deebo Samuel lost two yards on the ensuing first down.
Fast forward to the third quarter, when the 49ers had every opportunity in the world to put the Chiefs away, they only mustered one yard of offense on first downs.
That’s right. Four possessions, five plays, one yard. And we’re not talking about some run-of-the-mill offense here. This year’s version of the 49ers put up eye-popping numbers all season.
After the game, Brock Purdy was asked what attributed to the slow second-half start:
“I’m still trying to figure it out, I’m not going to lie. I think first and second down, we just got to be better. You get into these third and longs and it’s tough to convert in those kind of situations. So, just got to be better, I think first and second down. There’s just a couple plays where I feel like defense got stops like they needed to and then our first couple plays were just either negative or we’re not moving the ball. So, it’s as simple as that.”
In the Super Bowl, the 49ers generated -0.31 EPA per rush but had a 48 percent success rate. Conversely, a 45 percent success rate — slightly below average — through the air, but a positive 0.30 EPA.
The main culprit here can be pointed to the offensive line, which we’ll touch on later.

      title: 'Texans Value of Things: Fixing officiating in the NFL',
      article: '''This is always a touchy subject and it is one that has been on my mind for awhile. Still, I wanted to wait until the end of the season because any mention of officials is always associated with sour grapes. Ask any San Francisco 49ers fan and they will point to a call or two that they feel cost them the game. I don’t root for the Kansas City Chiefs or the 49ers, so I feel this is a perfect time to address the issue.
As my name suggests, I used to be a high school volleyball coach. I also grew up with a father that refereed college basketball and some high school football games. While I am not a referee myself, I have served as one in my role as a volleyball coach and know the feeling of having coaches and fans yell at me over calls they feel I missed.
There was probably a time when my father could have moved on to be an NBA official, but it would have meant quitting his job as a central office administrator in the school district he worked. That’s a difference between the NBA and NFL we will get to in a minute. So, he was stuck in college and big time high school games for awhile where he would have to travel throughout Texas and sometimes Oklahoma and Arkansas to referee in the Southwest Conference. 
Make Officials Full-Time Employees
Everyone remembers the second Jacksonville Jaguars game and some of the questionable calls in that game. It seems insane, but the head referee in that game is a varsity basketball coach in Oklahoma. How in the heck can someone do a great job at either with all of the travel? Naturally, making officials full-time also means giving them a full salary. It is unbelievable that a multi-billion dollar industry is relying on part-time employees to officiate their sport.
Compelling officials to work full time means they could spend the week going to meetings, watching video replay of their recent games, and probably doing more conditioning to make sure they can keep up. I know from experience that officials do the best they can to get it right and no one can be expected to be 100 percent accurate, but if they were spending 40 hours a week in training, watching old game tape, and reviewing tendencies of the teams in the upcoming game then they could be more accurate and consistent.
Revise the Rule Book
Quite simply, there are rules that have a direct impact on the game and some that are seemingly there because some anal-retentive jackass just felt they should be there. Does anyone really think illegal formations really impact the game? If the team wanted to line up nine guys behind the quarterback it would be incredibly stupid, but it would sure be entertaining to watch someone try.''',

      title: 'Haason Reddick addresses Eagles trade rumors',
      article: '''Super Bowl Sunday ended up being notable for Eagles fans with news that the organization gave Haason Reddick permission to seek a trade. It appeared as though Reddick was unhappy toward the end of the 2023 season, but the EDGE defender clarified the situation on Tuesday, noting that he didn’t ask for a trade and actually wants to work out an extension to stay in Philly.
“I would like to get an extension done here at home. At no point did I ever tell the organization I want to be traded,” Reddick said, according to Jordan Schultz of Bleacher Report. “This is home for me. I was born and raised here. Two of the most fun years playing football in my life came here. I’ve cherished being an Eagle.”
Reddick has one year left on his deal with the team, with none of his remaining contract money guaranteed. While the Philly native reiterated that he never asked for a trade, he also admitted that he understands it’s all a business, and he’s prepared for whatever is next. 
The Eagles were aware of the top defender needing a new contract, which led to them informing Reddick’s team that they could explore trade options. Although, that’s also far from the team actively working to unload their sack-leader.
It’s reassuring that Reddick actually wants to stay in Philly long-term, especially given how impactful he’s been for the defense through his two years with the team. His frustrations at the end of last season were more than a little justified, notably so when Matt Patricia had the pass-rusher dropping back in coverage rather than getting after QBs.
While the Eagles still have Josh Sweat under contract and rookie Nolan Smith on a rookie deal, to say the defense would be as dynamic without Reddick would be foolish. The Eagles have to know this, but are likely still hoping to get him back at a reasonable price. Letting Reddick explore trade options might show the DE what his value would be in free agency, which would give both sides a better picture of how they might move forward together.

      title: '49ers loss shows McVay and Rams must prioritize special teams',
      article: '''It’s no secret that the Los Angeles Rams struggled on special teams throughout the 2023 season. They weren’t just bad on that unit as DVOA had them as one of the worst special teams groups of all-time. The Rams lost games to the Baltimore Ravens because of special teams and it can be argued that they lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers due to missed field goals that gave short fields. They also almost lost to the New York Giants late in the season due to the coverage unit on special teams.
However, the Rams didn’t lose on the biggest stage due to a special teams gaffe. While they lost by one-point to the Detroit Lions in the playoffs, it wasn’t because of a missed extra point and the special teams unit did their job. The same cannot be said for the San Francisco 49ers.
The 49ers arguably lost the Super Bowl due to mistakes on special teams. In the third quarter, it was a muffed punt that gave the Chiefs a short field in the red zone. On the first play, Patrick Mahomes hit Marquez Valdes-Scantling in the end zone for a touchdown. The Chiefs had been struggling on offense up to that point and that score ended up being the only touchdown for Kansas City until the game-winner in overtime. That touchdown also gave the Chiefs their first lead of the game. 
That wasn’t the only special teams mistake, however. The 49ers actually answered that score with a 12-play touchdown drive of their own. The issue was that rookie kicker Jake Moody missed the extra point as it was blocked. Instead of being up 17-13 and the Chiefs needing a touchdown to take the lead, the blocked attempt kept it a three-point game. That special teams mistake kept the possibility of overtime as an option. The 49ers arguably could have won 20-16 with Mahomes and the Chiefs offense coming up short of the end zone at the end of regulation. Instead, the game went to overtime and the rest is history. Now, Moody did make two long field goals, but it was the blocked extra-point that ended up being costly and a big difference in a close game.
The two biggest mistakes for the 49ers came on special teams and it was those two mistakes that cost them their first Super Bowl championship in 29 years. Coming into the season, the 49ers drafted Jake Moody in the third-round. While Moody was mostly good this year, the Super Bowl wasn’t the only time that he cost the 49ers this season. Early in the year, Moody handed the 49ers their first loss when he missed a 41-yard field goal at the end of the game against the Cleveland Browns. He also had a miss in the loss to the Minnesota Vikings that would have made a five-point game a two-game on the final possession. They inve 
sted in a rookie kicker and it ended up costing them, despite spending a third-round pick.
San Francisco only ranked 25th in special teams DVOA this season. Contrarily, the Chiefs ranked sixth.
If anything, it’s a reminder for Sean McVay and the Rams that they need to prioritize special teams this offseason. It’s understandable not wanting to pay a Matt Gay the price tag that he was looking for last year in free agency. At the same time, there needed to be a plan in place instead of spending the entire season shuffling through kickers. It didn’t cost the Rams this year in what was a re-tooling season. Still, as the 49ers showed, it can cost you when it matters the most. Los Angeles must find a reliable kicker this offseason and find some stability as the returner position as well. Over the next two years, the Rams will be pushing for a Super Bowl title. They don’t want a special teams gaffe to cost them when they are competing for a Lombardi Trophy.''',

Steelers Have Huge Plans for Offseason | Noah Strackbein, All Steelers
The Pittsburgh Steelers are doing something they haven’t done in a long time - moving fast. Just one day into the 2024 season, the team has moved on from three former starters and has begun clearing cap space for free agency.
The moves weren’t a surprise, but how quickly they happened was. Usually, the Steelers are a team that waits, evaluates, and makes decisions based on current circumstances. But with three moves right off the bat, it feels like they have a different outlook on the 2024 offseason. 
T.J. Watt dismissive of critique by Steelers legend | Allison Koehler, Steelers Wire
The dynamics of the Pittsburgh Steelers locker room were under a microscope for much of the team’s 2023 season. Star defender T.J. Watt was pressed about it in an interview during Super Bowl 58 media week, particularly as it pertained to Ben Roethlisberger’s criticism of Steelers tradition last December.
“At the end of the day, it’s all about the guys in the locker room and it’s hard for people on the outside to truly get a feel for what’s going on on the inside,” Watt said in a Feb. 8 interview with Yahoo Sports’ Jason Fitz.

PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh Steelers are looking for a quarterback this offseason, and Justin Fields could be climbing up their list. According to NFL insider Benjamin Allbright, Pittsburgh is expected to call the Chicago Bears for their former first-round pick.
Allbright says the Steelers are one of three teams he expects to call Chicago for Fields. ESPN’s Adam Schefter also noted head coach Mike Tomlin is a big fan of Fields, and that Pittsburgh is going to look for outside options to bring in.

      title: 'Patrick Mahomes hasn’t surpassed Tom Brady as the GOAT yet',
      article: '''The Kansas City Chiefs have solidified their dynasty by coming away victoriously in only the second ever overtime game in Super Bowl history. Their 25-22 win over the San Francisco 49ers means that they have now won three championships in five years, and played in four total, losing only to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers along the way.
Because we live in a 24-hour news cycle, and plenty of fans and analysts alike are prisoners of the moment, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has since been hailed as the greatest to ever do it by countless people.
What he has accomplished so far has been nothing short of impressive, there is no question. However, I’m not here to throw out the rest of NFL history. Instead, let’s give a sensible opinion about where the GOAT discussion stands right now.
Let’s start by saying that Mahomes is starting his career better than anyone in NFL history, even including Tom Brady. He’s been a starter for six seasons, has made the AFC Championship Game in all six of them, made the Super Bowl in four, and has finished as Super Bowl MVP three times. He is the best player in the NFL right now by a wide margin, and his team is the newest NFL dynasty. 
As great as Mahomes has been, he is still far behind Brady when it comes to career accomplishments. This isn’t to take anything away from Mahomes, but to point out that Brady wasn’t great for six years — Brady was great for more than 20.
Some of the signature wins and drives by Brady are the stuff of legends, and he left his mark on this game in a way that no one before him had ever dreamed of. Winning seven Super Bowls is, frankly, ridiculous; he’s almost double the next highest QB, and, even with Mahomes in the league, there are serious questions whether that number will ever be matched in a salary cap and free agency era.
Along the way, Brady’s New England Patriots rebuilt on the fly. Morphing from a running team with receivers like Troy Brown, David Patten, Deion Branch, and David Givens, into a high-flying offense featuring the likes of Randy Moss, Wes Welker, and Donté Stallworth. Then finally, into the final stage, where the Patriots relied so heavily on Brady, and surrounded him with players such as Rob Gronkowski, Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, and Chris Hogan. 
Then, Brady went on to Tampa Bay and immediately had a transformative effect on the organization. After 17 years without a playoff win, the Buccaneers were led to a Super Bowl win (over Mahomes and the then-reigning champion Chiefs) in Brady’s first season. He ended his Bucs career with five playoff victories in three seasons, one shy of the franchise’s total in its first 44 years of existence.
Through no fault of his own — he is still only 28 and coming off his seventh NFL season — Mahomes has not gone through anything like this.
Yes, Tyreek Hill has moved on, as have other players surrounding him. But Travis Kelce has always been his top target, and head coach Andy Reid has been calling the shots throughout Mahomes’ career. Once they decide to step away, how will he respond?
Then, there are the wins.
Mahomes has come from behind to win all of his Super Bowls, and that is something that always set Brady apart as well. It didn’t matter what the score was after the first quarter, the first half, or even half way through the third quarter. As long as Brady or Mahomes are your QBs, you feel like you have a chance to win.With wins against the Philadelphia Eagles and now the 49ers twice, Mahomes has put himself in elite company. As impressive as those victories have been, though, Brady has had a few that might never be topped.
Two fourth-quarter touchdown drives to erase a 10-point deficit against the best defense in NFL history — because that’s exactly what the Seattle Seahawks would have been if Brady hadn’t come back — looked like a signature moment. Seattle was on the verge of beating Peyton Manning and Brady in back-to-back Super Bowls, and he came back and won the game by playing possibly the cleanest quarter of football you will ever see.
Of course there’s the Malcolm Butler interception, and neither the coaching nor the execution across the board on that single play should be ignored. But his two drives that put the Patriots ahead 28-24 in the first place are all-timers. Brady, at that point in the game, very much seemed inevitable like Mahomes on Sunday against the 49ers.With wins against the Philadelphia Eagles and now the 49ers twice, Mahomes has put himself in elite company.

      article: '''While the 2024 NFL league year doesn’t officially begin for another month, we know one player that won’t be back in Pittsburgh.

He signed an extension with the Steelers in May of 2023, a move that was designed to free up cap space. However, Trubisky’s performance saw him get benched for Mason Rudolph after losing his only two starts of the season against the  New England Patriots  and  Indianapolis Colts.   
The Steelers went 2-5 in Trubisky’s seven starts over the last two seasons. In his 12 appearances in that span, he threw eight touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He will now seek a new start on a new team once he is able to do so in March.''',

If he stays at right tackle, do they look for an upgrade over Dan Moore Jr., who has allowed one of the highest pressure rates in the NFL two years in a row?

      title: 'Position-by-position grades from the 49ers crushing Super Bowl LVIII loss',
      article: '''The  San Francisco 49ers  fell short in  Super Bowl  LVIII, losing 25-22 in overtime to Patrick Mahomes and Kansas City. The 49ers led 16-13 with less than two minutes left in regulation. Then led 22-19 in overtime. The Niners defense was just one stop away from the title. Instead, Mahomes further fueled GOAT conversations as he raised the Lombardi Trophy once again.
Here are position-by-position grades for the game:
Quarterbacks: C+
Brock Purdy had a couple of throws that could have been picked off, but one was because of a drop by Deebo Samuel and the other would have been a fantastic play by Trent McDuffie. The fact is, Purdy did a great job avoiding negative plays. He had no turnovers and only took one sack despite a rough day from the offensive line. With that said, it was also one of his least efficient games of the season and lacked one of those signature late-game dimes that seemed to clinch so many wins this season. Chris Jones undeniably led Purdy to airmail some downfield opportunities, but this was not akin to Super Bowl LV, when Tampa Bay derailed Mahomes and Kansas City’s offense through pressure. We’ve seen Purdy find a way to complete those throws at other moments. Purdy had a solid, bordering on above-average overall performance, but that was it.
Running backs: B+
Christian McCaffrey was once again the 49ers most dynamic weapon, racking up 160 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown. But he also fumbled on the 49ers first possession inside Kansas City’s 30. It cost San Francisco a field-goal attempt and possibly even more points. Balancing out the positives and negatives from McCaffrey’s day brings the unit’s grade to a B, but Kyle Juszczyk’s impact as a blocked and on a pair of receptions lifts it a bit higher. 
Tight ends: C+
George Kittle hauled in a crucial fourth-down conversion late in the fourth quarter that led to the 49ers final touchdown drive of the game. However, the 49ers tight end was relegated by injuries, playcalling, and Kansas City’s defense to primarily impacting the game solely as a blocker the rest of the way. When Kittle was briefly sidelined by injury, Brayden Willis was called for a hold.
Wide receivers: B
Jauan Jennings may have had a strong case for Super Bowl MVP if the 49ers had pulled out the victory. He completed a touchdown pass to McCaffrey on a fun trick play in the first half and caught Purdy’s only touchdown in the second. Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel were both held in check by Kansas City’s top corners. Airyuk led San Francisco’s wideouts with 49 receiving yards on just three receptions (six targets). Samuel caught just three of his 11 targets for 33 yards. Granted, Samuel could have had some big plays downfield if Purdy had made more accurate throws.
Offensive line: D
Perhaps it’s unfair to knock the unit so much for getting dominated by Chris Jones who, after all, dominates most opponents. But the 49ers offensive line allowed Jones to dictate far too much of the game. McCaffrey racked up yards, but was rarely able to get anything going on inside runs, an area Kansas City had struggled in throughout the season. The 49ers offensive line had too many mixups in pass coverage against Steve Spagnuolo’s blitz-heavy approach. Even Trent Williams got called for a couple of out of character penalties. 
Defensive line: A-
The 49ers defensive line was finally living up to expectations in the first half. Chase Young and Randy Gregory were wreaking havoc opposite of Nick Bosa while Arik Armstead was a force on the interior alongside Javon Hargrave and Javon Kinlaw. Yet, as the game wore on, the line seemed to tire, allowing Mahomes to get going and mount a comeback. The line generated three sacks, five tackles for loss, and seven quarterback hits over the course of the contest, and played quite well, but the result looks different if they had a stronger kick.
Linebackers: B+
Early in the game, Dre Greenlaw and Fred Warner were playing out of their minds. There may not be a linebacker in football who seems to take over games as completely as Greenlaw when he is at his best. Of course, Greenlaw was sidelined early, however, with a heartbreaking Achilles injury and was out for most of the game. Warner was able to keep Travis Kelce quiet for most of the game, but got beat for a big play late in the fourth quarter.
Oren Burks and Demetrius Flanagan-Fowles were solid in place of Greenlaw, but there is a difference between facing two dominant linebackers and a duo with a clear weaker link. As 49ers fans relive those designed runs for Mahomes, it’s hard not to think about Greenlaw’s dynamic speed making a difference if he didn’t bite on the fake. 
Cornerbacks: B
The 49ers corners had the easiest task, and while they may not have dominated, they made sure that Kansas City’s receivers did not change any perceptions.
Safeties: B
The 49ers safeties had some big coverage lapses, but Ji’Ayir Brown also made the defense’s best play of the game, intercepting a Mahomes pass.
Special teams: D
It’s a shame that Mitch Wishnowsky and Chris Conley’s exceptional special teams performances were overshadowed by a fumbled punt return and Jake Moody’s missed extra point, arguably the 49ers two most costly mistakes of the game. Moody made all three of his field goals, including a pair from beyond 50 yards, but his low extra point and the punt that landed on Darrel Luter Jr’s foot and could not be recovered by Ray-Ray McCloud will haunt the Niners faithful for years.''',
